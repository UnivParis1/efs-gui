It can be used to identify experts in connection with a press article project, to solicit potential participants for an event or to find a supervisor for a thesis or dissertation.",
    "form.info.panel.title2": "How to use this tool?",
    "form.info.panel.desc2": "We recommend that you enter a complete and detailed statement, making sure that spelling and case are correct. You can influence the results by adjusting the degree of semantic extension of the search, to make it more or less precise, by including or not including the co-authors of the publications (outside Paris 1), by changing the language model (Sentence Bert or GPT-3). You can choose between two display modes, cloud or list, whose results are not classified exactly the same way (see below).",
    "form.info.panel.title3": "What is the basis for identifying experts?",
    "form.info.panel.desc3": "The experts suggested by this application are those who have deposited in the Hal collection of Paris 1 articles on subjects close to your query, according to their titles or their abstracts. If a researcher who works on a subject does not appear in the search results for this subject, it may be that some of his publications are not yet present in the Hal collection of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, or that their titles and descriptions are not sufficiently explicit, or that their author is not correctly attached to his laboratory in the Hal repository. If an author corrects this information on Hal, the research tool of expertise will be updated under 24H",

    "form.info.panel.desc4": "Modern language models (transformers) such as Bert or GPT are neural networks with a particular architecture that allows them to encode the meaning of language in mathematical structures. These structures are used by this tool to identify articles related to the topic you have submitted: researchers' publications are identified according to their degree of semantic proximity, in a high-dimensional vector space, to the sentence you have written, even if the words or the language used differ.",
    "form.info.panel.title5": "How are the results ranked?",
    "form.info.panel.desc5": "In the cloud view, a researcher's name appears in larger font the more the algorithm has identified among the titles and abstracts of publications on Hal many statements related to your topic. When you increase the semantic scope of the search, some researchers are likely to be highlighted for having produced several works on relatively close topics. In the list view, on the other hand, the ranking only takes into account the publication closest to your topic by its title or a sentence of its abstract.",
